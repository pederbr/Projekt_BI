# Projekt_BI

We're considering a side project for Project BI to better leverage the data we receive from company presentations. The goal is to use this information more effectively, with the hope of playing a more significant role in processes like the "Bookingrunden". By making better use of the insights gained during these presentations, we aim to enhance the importance of this data, incorporating it into decision-making and strategic planning. The idea is to streamline how we handle information and maximize its impact on key operational aspects, particularly during events like the "Bookingrunden".

The plan is to enable the upload of a CSV file containing the results from the company presentation onto a website, where everything is stored and preserved for later use. There will be an 'overall score' that ranks how 'good' the company presentation is, and we believe this can contribute to a more accurate understanding of the quality of a company presentation.

The project will primarily be built on straightforward data management using Python (Django).
